title: Layout Elements
---

ELEMENTS uses a Flex Box based layout system, just like UI Toolkit. This is made easily accessible using layout elements called Groups.

There are two main types of group: `VerticalGroup`, and `HorizontalGroup`. As the names suggest, these elements render their children either vertically or horizontally. You can also easily control the alignment of the children within these groups.

## Examples

To create a `VerticalGroup`...

```csharp
return new VerticalGroup(
  child,
  child
  child
)
```

<Example title="Vertical Group">
  <VerticalGroup>
    <Label>Child</Label>
    <Label>Child</Label>
    <Label>Child</Label>
  </VerticalGroup>
</Example>

To create a `HorizontalGroup`...

```csharp
return new HorizontalGroup(
  child,
  child,
  child
)
```

<Example title="Horizontal Group">
  <HorizontalGroup>
    <Label>Child</Label>
    <Label>Child</Label>
    <Label>Child</Label>
  </HorizontalGroup>
</Example>

## Alignment and justification

Typically alignment and justification on a group are controlled using USS, however ELEMENTS provides handy convenience methods to easily adjust this.

```csharp
return new HorizontalGroup(
  child,
  child,
  child
).AlignItems(Align.Center).JustifyContent(Justify.SpaceBetween)
```

<Example title="Horizontal Group">
  <HorizontalGroup className="items-center justify-between">
    <Label>Child</Label>
    <Label>Child</Label>
    <Label>Child</Label>
  </HorizontalGroup>
</Example>

## Child pseudo-classes

ELEMENTS automatically applies pseudo-classes to children of any `Group`. These classes are applied when `BuildVisualElement()` is called and can be targeted in your USS stylesheets for positional styling.

| Class | Applied to |
|-------|-----------|
| `.first-child` | The first child element |
| `.last-child` | The last child element |
| `.even-child` | Children at even indices (0, 2, 4...) |
| `.odd-child` | Children at odd indices (1, 3, 5...) |

You can target these in your USS stylesheets:

```css
/* Zebra-stripe rows */
.my-list > .even-child {
    background-color: #f8fafc;
}

.my-list > .odd-child {
    background-color: #ffffff;
}

/* Remove bottom border on last item */
.my-list > .last-child {
    border-bottom-width: 0;
}
```

These pseudo-classes are also used internally by the built-in [gap utility classes](/docs/utility-classes#built-in-gap-utilities) — `.first-child` resets the margin to zero so the first item has no leading space.
