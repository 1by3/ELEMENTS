ELEMENTS allows you to style your UI using Unit's USS. If you're familiar with CSS from web development, you'll be right at home.

## Loading stylesheets

To load a stylesheet, you can call the `StyleSheet` method on any element. This will apply the stylesheet to that element and its descendants.

```csharp
return new VerticalGroup(
  child,
  child
).StyleSheet("Path/To/Stylesheet/Resource");
```

You can pass a resource string to load the stylesheet via its path. This will search all `Resources` folders in your `Assets` folder for the path specified. For example, if your stylesheet is located at `Assets/Resources/Styles/MyStyles.uss` you would load these with `.StyleSheet("Styles/MyStyles")`. Note the `.uss` extension is omitted.

You can also pass an instance of `StyleSheet` directly to this method if you have it available.

## Classes

You can assign a class to any element using the `ClassName` method...

```csharp
new Label("My Label").ClassName("fancy-label");
```

And then style it in a stylesheet...

```css
.label {
  color: pink;
}
```

<Example title="Styled Label">
  <Label className="text-pink-500">My Label</Label>
</Example>

To add multiple classes, call `ClassName` repeatedly...

```csharp
new Label("My Label")
  .ClassName("fancy-label")
  .ClassName("another-class");
```

## Conditional classes

If you want to conditionally apply a class, you can pass a second boolean parameter to the `ClassName` method...

```csharp
var isFancy = false;

return new Label("My Label").ClassName("fancy-label", isFancy)
```

This is more useful with the `BindClassName` method which takes an `Observable<bool>` and automatically updates the class name when the observable value changes.

```csharp
return new Label("My Label").BindClassName("fancy-label", ViewModel.IsFancy);
```

## Names

You can also assign a name to an element using the `Name` method. Names are unique to the element and can be thought of like IDs in USS.

```csharp
return new Label("My Label").Name("my-label");
```

```css
my-label {
  color: blue;
}
```

Name is also a bindable property, so you can bind it to a value in your view model.

```csharp
return new Label("My Label").BindName(ViewModel.LabelName);
```
