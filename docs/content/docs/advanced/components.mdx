title: Components
---

In ELEMENTS, your UI is made up of a series of "Components". A Component is a pairing of a View and a View Model. Your views can also render components within themselves in order to facilitate code re-use and composition.

```csharp
return new VerticalGroup(
  new Label("Users"),
  Component<UserListViewModel, UserListView>()
);
```

## Configuring the component

In some cases, you might need to configure the child component, or make it interact with properties of your parent component's view model. The `Component` method can be passed a configure action which receives the instantiated view model for this purpose...

```csharp
return new VerticalGroup(
  new Label("Users"),
  new TextField(ViewModel.SearchQuery).Placeholder("Search users by name..."),

  Component<UserListViewModel, UserListView>(vm => vm.BindNameSearch(ViewModel.SearchQuery)))
);
```

This same pattern can be used to expose events from the sub-component...

```csharp
return new VerticalGroup(
  new Label("Users"),
  new TextField(ViewModel.SearchQuery).Placeholder("Search users by name..."),

  Component<UserListViewModel, UserListView>(vm =>
  {
    vm.BindNameSearch(ViewModel.SearchQuery));
    vm.CreateUserClicked += ViewModel.CreateNewUser;
  })
);
```
