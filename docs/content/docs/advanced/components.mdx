title: Components

In ELEMENTS, your UI is made up of a series of "Components". A Component is a single class that extends `Component` and implements `IElement`, so it composes into element trees just like any other element.

```csharp
return new VerticalGroup(
  new Label("Users"),
  new UserList()
);
```

## Configuring the component

Components receive configuration through constructors or public methods. Pass reactive properties through constructors to enable communication between parent and child components...

```csharp
return new VerticalGroup(
  new Label("Users"),
  new TextField(SearchQuery).Placeholder("Search users by name..."),

  new UserList(SearchQuery)
);
```

This same pattern can be used to expose events from the sub-component...

```csharp
public class UserList : Component
{
    public Action<User> OnUserSelected;

    private readonly Observable<string> searchQuery;

    public UserList(Observable<string> searchQuery)
    {
        this.searchQuery = searchQuery;
    }

    protected override IElement Render()
    {
        // Use searchQuery to filter, call OnUserSelected when clicked
    }
}

// In parent Component's Render:
var userList = new UserList(SearchQuery);
userList.OnUserSelected = user => SelectUser(user);
```
